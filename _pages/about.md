Hello there!
======
I am an Applied Scientist at Microsoft working at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Embodied AI. Within these broad areas, I am especially keen on exploring research directions which can lead to (1) interactive systems that can communicate with humans (and other computational systems) using natural language and enhance their decision-making capabilities under uncertainties. Furthermore, I would like to extend these works to (2) create generalizable, safe and effective technologies to support and benefit vulnerable groups.

I have been part of the organizing team for the NeurIPS 2021 and 2022 competition on Interactive Grounded Language Understanding in a Collaborative Environment [(IGLU)](https://www.iglu-contest.net/) competition. The goal of this competition is to build embodied agents that learn to solve a task while provided with grounded natural language instructions.
