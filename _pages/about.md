Hello!
======
I am a graduate student researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology advised by Professor [Deb Roy](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dkroy/overview/){:target="_blank"}. My research work is at the intersection of natural language processing and computational social science, with a primary focus on multimodal interactive systems and the creation of comprehensive multimodal datasets. Currently, I am excited about exploring and assessing large language models, with the goal of advancing socially aware dialogue understanding systems that embrace diverse voices and perspectives. 

Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Microsoft, where I worked in the areas of multilingual content understanding and recommendations for News, and my research focused on interactive grounded language understanding for agents in a collaborative environment. I was an organizer for the NeurIPS 2021 and 2022 competition [(IGLU)](https://www.iglu-contest.net/){:target="_blank"}. I obtained my M.S in Machine Learning (ML) from UC Berkeley where my research delved into ML-driven methods to develop strategies for natural disaster risk reduction advised by Professor [Ken Goldberg](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/goldberg.html){:target="_blank"} and Professor [Brandie Nonnecke](https://nonnecke.com/){:target="_blank"}, and explainable ML in public policy advised by Professor [David Bamman](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~dbamman/){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to [email](mailto:shresmoh@mit.edu) me if you are interested in research collaborations.

<!--
a Applied Scientist at Microsoft working at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Embodied AI. Within these broad areas, I am especially keen on exploring research directions which can lead to interactive systems that can communicate with humans (and other computational systems) using natural language and multi-modal inputs to enhance their decision-making capabilities under uncertainties. 
I am in the core organizing team for the NeurIPS 2021 and 2022 competition on Interactive Grounded Language Understanding in a Collaborative Environment [(IGLU)](https://www.iglu-contest.net/) competition. The goal of this competition is to build embodied agents that learn to solve a task while provided with grounded natural language instructions.
